# Asynchronous Migration

The main goal of this project is to show the migration from an Android project with callbacks to one with coroutines.

We are using a [Digimon API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/14059948/TzecB4fH) to fetch a list of digimons and displaying on a *LazyColumn*

## Migration Steps

There will be 3 branches displaying the migration steps from callback, to Rxjava to coroutines

* Callbacks
* RxJava
* Coroutines
